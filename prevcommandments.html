                    <h4>1. Seekers of knowledge</h4>
                        <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Study, learn information, memorize important facts and dates. Refine ones cognitive ability.</p>
                        <p><strong>If failed: </strong>Failure to refine knowledge must be admitted and regret expressed through compensatinon either physically or mentally. Study a textbook for at least two hours, attempt an amount of pushups 1.5x the amount you are capable of in one sitting, learn and memorize 50 words of a language, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason for following: </strong>Refinement of knowledge can result in more effective metacognition and therefore happiness through intentional alteration of ones lifestyle or behaviour.</p>
                    <h4>2. Creatures of habit</h4>
                        <a><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Keep a healthy routine.</p>
                        <p><strong>If failed: </strong>This is the least important commandment, don't fret. Do a few pushups and try not to inhibit hopelessness which may arise dismantling habit. If habit is not being kept due to ones mood being low, recordkeeping can act as a therapy or a resource in consulting with a trusted one.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason for following: </strong>Habit allows one to know they are mentally healthy and their ego is at a safe level – if ones ego/mood is too low, one may not follow habit. Ones ego being too high is accounted for via generosity and other social interactions.</p>
                    <h4>3. Social animals</h4>
                        <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Socialise and form new relationships</p>
                        <p><strong>If failed: </strong>Invite someone out to do something fun, or to your house, prioritising talking and bonding with them.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason for following: </strong>Social connections are vital in being mentally healthy. Socially connecting with others allows for both recognition of one's flaws and aspiration to become better via revering another. There is also the chemical benefit of all the good shit in your brain (serotonin and that) and feeling appreciated. Recordkeeping should allow for one to determine the legitimacy of ones friendships and practice of studying character and microexpressions shall further allow the judging of anothers character. If you find someone rude for no reason, talk to them about it, and mentally acknowledge their individuality in order to not judge someone without context, as this can manifest into hatred and therefore other negative emotions. <i>An essay on this topic will be written!</i></p>
                    <h4>4. Avarice as a sin</h4>
                        <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Do not allow greed to overcome yourself. Consider monetary and important decisions morally beforehand, recording your internal debate.</p>
                        <p><strong>If failed: </strong>Feign the results of avarice, either from yourself or in a way that can also benefit other individuals that may deserve it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason for following: </strong>Avarice can cause further greed and immoralities. While seeking fortune is fine, putting others that do not deserve misfortune behind without it being morally appropriate is a terrible habit and will eventually result in unhappiness due to both avarice and other immoralities in future if kept in ones behaviour.</p>
                    <h4>5. The gift of giving</h4>
                        <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Give to others without seeking recognition. Help those in need. This does not mean to go without, but instead be generous and kind. Compliments are also appreciated.</p>
                        <p><strong>If failed: </strong>Part with something meaningful; donate to charity; give a value in which you feel you owe</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason for following: </strong>While similar to our social requirement and caution of avarice, giving is important in feigning greed, envy and pride (without the desire for recognition). This also helps emotionally in knowing you have helped others and allows for more relationships, friendships etc. to be formed. Giving may also cause one to give back, whether to you or another, and in turn helps make the world and our environment better somewhat.</p>
                    <h4>6. It's in the archives</h4>
                        <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Keep a record of your thoughts, concerns, achievements and all else. Dreams are important. Keep this information secure.</p>
                        <p><strong>If failed: </strong>This will be a punishment in itself at some point, but is the least serious offence.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason for following: </strong>Apart from my sentimental attachment to my dreams, they along with ones thoughts can be used to refine metacognition and refer to if information is needed. For peace of mind, keep the information secure and encrypted if deemed necessary. This can also help one understand their desires – their pursuits – and their values, problems, etc.</p>
